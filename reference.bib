These velocities exhibit large scatter and no correlation with plastic strain, crystal size or applied stress. Statistical analysis for the displacement jump velocities shows a cubic power-law decay, with a shoulder at low velocities. Our results indicate that the collective motion of dislocations in the deforming crystals is dominated by statistical fluctuations within the internal stresses, rather than by a mobility law that depends on the externally applied stress."

While dislocation multiplication is well-understood, how the avalanches form, however, is not clear, and the lack of insight in general has contributed to ``a mass of details and controversy'' about crystal plasticity. Here, we follow the development of dislocation avalanches in the compressed nanopillars of a high entropy alloy, Al0.1CoCrFeNi, using direct electron imaging and precise mechanical measurements. Results show that the avalanche starts with dislocation accumulations and the formation of dislocation bands. Dislocation pileups form in front of the dislocation bands, whose giveaway trigs the avalanche, like the opening of a floodgate. The size of dislocation avalanches ranges from few to 102{\thinspace}nm in the nanopillars, with the power-law distribution similar to earthquakes. Thus, our study identifies the dislocation interaction mechanism for large crystal slips, and provides critical insights into the deformation of high entropy alloys.},

The foremost point is how to define operative or effective stress and drag or slip system resistance. Specific choice of the definition leads to a unique number of implications including lattice rotation and slip activities, and we will highlight a few of them. We examined these three flow rules within finite strain framework with a single crystalline Al-rich TiAl binary alloy at very high homologous temperature with three strain rate controlled experimental data . It is revealed that two internal variables based flow rules give better results with a wide variety of applicability in plasticity and related phenomena.}

In plastically deformed microcrystals, internal dislocation avalanches lead to jumps in the stress-strain curves (strain bursts), whereas in macroscopic samples plasticity appears as a smooth process. By combining three-dimensional simulations of the dynamics of interacting dislocations with statistical analysis of the corresponding deformation behavior, we determined the distribution of strain changes during dislocation avalanches and established its dependence on microcrystal size. Our results suggest that for sample dimensions on the micrometer and submicrometer scale, large strain fluctuations may make it difficult to control the resulting shape in a plastic-forming process.},

abstract="Atom-based modeling and simulation are essential for the understanding and development of structural materials such as crystalline and amorphous metals. Classical molecular dynamics simulation enables the following of atomic-level structural evolution to elucidate the atomic processes underlying many macroscopic behaviors; however its predictive power is constrained by an intrinsic time-scale limitation. Here, we describe an alternative approach based on potential energy landscape modeling and transition state theory to probe the microscopic mechanisms controlling deformation and plastic flow observed in experiments. We survey several examples of slow deformation in crystals and metallic glasses to illustrate the computational algorithms used to perform the simulations and to reveal the underpinning elementary plastic processes that operate in crystalline and amorphous materials. We first show the evolution of dislocations and their interactions with obstacles over a wide range of strain rates and temperatures and discuss how they lead to macroscopic behaviors such as flow stress upturn and dislocation channeling. Then we turn to amorphous plasticity where discrete stress relaxation (avalanche) processes arise in serrated flow and creep in metallic glasses. A nonlinear interplay between nonaffine atomic displacement and local shear transformation distortion is revealed that provides a molecular explanation of the deformation-rate upturn.",

Once they disentangle and move, they may also be impeded by permanent obstacles with finite energy barriers or frustrating long-range interactions. The outcome of such complexity is the emergence of dislocation avalanches as the basic mechanism of plastic flow in solids at the nanoscale. While the deformation behavior of bulk materials appears smooth, a predictive model should clearly be based upon the character of these dislocation avalanches and their associated strain bursts. We provide here a comprehensive overview of experimental observations, theoretical models and computational approaches that have been developed to unravel the multiple aspects of dislocation avalanche physics and the phenomena leading to strain bursts in crystal plasticity.}

title = {Mesoscale simulations of dislocation-obstacle interactions and dislocation avalanches},
abstract = {Plastic deformation in crystals is generated by the motion of line-like defects called dislocations, whose dynamics has thus the key role in determining the mechanical properties of crystalline materials like metals. In addition to line dislocations, metals can contain other defects that serve as obstacles for dislocation motion, leading to strengthening of the metal. The modelling of the interactions between these defects and dislocations is useful when developing new metal alloys. The interactions between dislocations themselves are based on the long-range anisotropic stress-fields that they generate by distorting the surrounding lattice. These long-range interactions and the motion constraints imposed by the lattice lead to complex dynamical behaviour. It has been observed in micropillar experiments of pure crystals that collective motion of dislocations happens in avalanches. The size and duration distributions of these avalanches follow power law scaling. It has been suggested that the exact form of these power laws could be explained with the idea that plastic yielding is a non-equilibrium phase transition. However, results from 2D discrete dislocation dynamics simulations indicate that in the case of pure crystals the collective dynamics of dislocations have glassy features similar to those found in jammed systems. In this thesis we use numerical simulations to study the properties of dislocations in different metals. In publication I we develop a multiscale framework for dislocation-precipitate interactions in body-centered cubic (BCC) iron. In this framework molecular dynamics simulations are used to provide physically justifiable input parameters for 3D discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD). The multiscale model is used in publication II to study the yielding of irradiated BCC iron at elevated temperatures. Irradiated iron contains line dislocations, precipitates and self-interstitial dislocation loops that impede dislocation motion. We show that precipitates and dislocation loops contribute equally to the yield stress when present at equal densities. In publication III we use extensive 3D DDD simulations to study dislocation avalanches in pure aluminium. Analysis of the avalanche statistics indicate that plastic deformation in face-centered cubic (FCC) crystals exhibit extended critical-like phase in analogy to glassy systems, instead of originating from a non-equilibrium phase transition at a critical stress.},
